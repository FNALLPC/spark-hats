# Big Data with Spark HATS

This Hands on Advanced Tutorial Session 
([HATS](http://lpc.fnal.gov/programs/schools-workshops/hats.shtml)) is
presented by the LPC to demonstrate a CMS analysis using
[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/),
[Spark-ROOT](https://github.com/diana-hep/spark-root),
[Histogrammar](http://histogrammar.org/), and
[MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/). After introducing Spark, students
will learn the steps needed to perform a basic measurement
of the Z-boson mass using CMS data recorded in 2016.

## Getting Started

Students of the HATS will be provided access to Vanderbilt's Big Data
cluster via [Jupyter](https://jupyter.accre.vanderbilt.edu) using their
GitHub username. The Jupyter instance contains both this repository and
all necessary software preconfigured.

### Pre-Exercises

The day before the tutorial, it's critical that each student perform the
pre-exercises. This way, any potential technical/login issues can be cleared
up beforehand. To perform the pre-exercises, connect to
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.accre.vanderbilt.edu). Once your server starts, 
navigate to
```
spark-hats/notebooks/00-preexercise.ipynb
```

### Accessing this Tutorial in Jupyter

Once logged into [Jupyter](https://jupyter.accre.vanderbilt.edu), navigate to the `spark-hats`
directory and open the notebook named `Start-Here.ipynb`
