    "\n",
    "With Jupyter, however, you first begin by starting Python *then* you pass snippets of code for Python to execute. Since the code is added incrementally to a constantly-running python process, intermediate values stay in-memory, and the coding cycle of \"write, execute, print outputs, loop\" becomes much more interactive. This mode of development isn't totally new, REPL (Read, Execute, Print, Loop) shells exist for a number of languages.\n",
